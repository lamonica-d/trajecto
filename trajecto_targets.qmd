# Description

This quarto file was produced during the EcoStat cours in Montpellier as part of the excercise 4 on Targets. This file is supposed to be integrated in the target pipeline. To make things smooth, small chunks of code should only incude calls to the 'tar_target' functions defined in my targettest.R file.

# Beforehand

## Packages

These are the packages I used for my file **test_targets.R** file.

```{r}
# library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes)
# library(ggplot2)
# library(visNetwork)
```

These are the packages I might use this file *.qmd*.

## Setup

These are the parameters to apply to this whole document (**report_targets.qmd**).

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| collapse: true

library(targets)
```
